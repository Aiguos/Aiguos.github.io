## Welcome to MIX reality group 


### Week 1 - Week 2

Introduction to the course and a quick walkthrough on how vofuria works in unity.
Managed to get a linerendere to reflect a beam once.

Progress was made we now have a fully working prototype showing the idea working.
We corrected a bug that made extra lines in the line rendere by incrementing the amount of lines allowed to be drawed per frame.
(Even under shitty lightning) 
We have set up image targets to add a laser and two walls. Each wall is set up as being a mirror. When the laser collides with the wall, the laser is reflected according to the angle of the laser impacting the wall.

During this weekâ€™s course in MIX, we experimented with another augmented reality game which was 'brick breaker'. But, we also tried to improve upon the product we already had which was the laser game. We got the reflection of lasers to work, and now we had to make use of this functionality and make a game out of it. We experimented with a sort of labyrinth, where the player would need to place the mirrors so that the laser would hit a goal to win the game. The player would have a limited amount of place able mirrors and the laser would be placed statically on the map. The goal would also be placed statically. The only things the player should be able to move is the limited number of mirrors at his disposal.

We were also able to experiment further with the brick breaker game, so that now we have a the basic functionality of the brick breaker game. Which means that we have a simple scene and a player controlled 'platform' which can bounce the ball when it hits.

All that would be required now is to add more imarge targets to work as bricks to be destroyed, that would be able to give a minimal viable product for the brick breaker game.
