## Welcome to MIX reality group 


### Week 1

Introduction to the course and a quick walkthrough on how vofuria works in unity.
Managed to get a linerendere to reflect a beam once.

### Week 2

Progress was made we now have a fully working prototype showing the idea working.
We corrected a bug that made extra lines in the line rendere by incrementing the amount of lines allowed to be drawed per frame.
( Even under shitty lightning )
