## Welcome to MIX reality group 


### Week 1 - Week 2

Introduction to the course and a quick walkthrough on how vofuria works in unity.
Managed to get a linerendere to reflect a beam once.

Progress was made we now have a fully working prototype showing the idea working.
We corrected a bug that made extra lines in the line rendere by incrementing the amount of lines allowed to be drawed per frame.
(Even under shitty lightning) 
We have set up image targets to add a laser and two walls. Each wall is set up as being a mirror. When the laser collides with the wall, the laser is reflected according to the angle of the laser impacting the wall.
